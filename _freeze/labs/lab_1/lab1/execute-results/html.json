The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n**Submit by posting your updated portfolio link on Canvas.** Your assignment should be accessible at `your-portfolio-url/labs/lab_1/`\n\nMake sure to update your `_quarto.yml` navigation to include this assignment under an \"Labs\" menu.\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\nCreate this assignment in your portfolio repository under an `labs/lab_1/` folder structure.

Consider: Which counties might be poorly served by algorithms that rely on this income data? What factors might contribute to higher uncertainty?]\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [write something :)]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names\n\n# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data\n# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter\n\n# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()\n# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations\n\n# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3.3 Demographic Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Analyze the demographic patterns in your selected areas.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find the tract with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino residents\n# Hint: use arrange() and slice() to get the top tract\n\n# Calculate average demographics by county using group_by() and summarize()\n# Show: number of tracts, average percentage for each racial/ethnic group\n\n# Create a nicely formatted table of your results using kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Part 4: Comprehensive Data Quality Evaluation\n\n## 4.1 MOE Analysis for Demographic Variables\n\n**Your Task:** Examine margins of error for demographic variables to see if some communities have less reliable data.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentages for each demographic variable\n- Flag tracts where any demographic variable has MOE > 15%\n- Create summary statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate MOE percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic variables\n# Hint: use the same formula as before (margin/estimate * 100)\n\n# Create a flag for tracts with high MOE on any demographic variable\n# Use logical operators (| for OR) in an ifelse() statement\n\n# Create summary statistics showing how many tracts have data quality issues\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 4.2 Pattern Analysis\n\n**Your Task:** Investigate whether data quality problems are randomly distributed or concentrated in certain types of communities.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Group tracts by whether they have high MOE issues\n# Calculate average characteristics for each group:\n# - population size, demographic percentages\n\n# Use group_by() and summarize() to create this comparison\n# Create a professional table showing the patterns\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Pattern Analysis:** [Describe any patterns you observe.
